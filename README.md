This repository contains the code that was used for the Sequential
MNIST, Penn Treebank and text8 experiments in the paper Recurrent
Batch Normalization (http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09025).  For the
Attentive Reader, see
https://github.com/cooijmanstim/Attentive_reader/tree/bn.

The `experiments` directory contains shell scripts that demonstrate
how to launch the experiments with the hyperparameters from the paper.
